# Demonstration of Missing Ability To Filter Based On Absence

This project demonstrates that there is no way to filter a string[] based on the absence of a field. Instead only the presence of a field is allowed as a filter.

To run the project:
```
npm install
npm run db:up
npm run start
npm run db:down
```
